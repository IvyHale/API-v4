## OVERVIEW
The Virgil Cards Service is the core service of the Virgil infrastructure and it's responsible for the Virgil Card entries management.
The main purpose of the Virgil Card entry is to store a user's Public Key with an optional identity which is issued on the application developer's side.

Card Service address:

https://cards.virgilsecurity.com/v4


## AUTHORIZATION
The Authorization HTTP header is mandatory for API calls that are related to the Virgil Cards with scope = "application" and is skipped for Virgil Cards with scope = "global". An access tokens for every application can be retrieved on the Virgil Development Portal.
The Authorization Header:

```
GET /v4/card/a6f7b874ea69329372ad75353314d7bc...
Host: cards.virgilsecurity.com
Authorization: VIRGIL { YOUR_APPLICATION_TOKEN }
```

Authorization has the following parameters:
|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|Authorization: required|This parameter indicates that the endpoint needs an authorization.|
|signs|This parameter is nested into the meta request parameter, an associative array that contains the signer's fingerprint, which is represented as Keys and Base64-encoded signs and values.|
|Fingerprint|This identifies a specific Virgil Card.|

The signs parameter has the following structure:
```
{
    "meta": {
        "signs": {
          "[CARD_HOLDER_ID]": "[VIRGIL_CARD_BASE64_ENCODED_SIGN_OF_THE_FINGERPRINT]",
          "[APPLICATION_ID]": "[VIRGIL_CARD_BASE64_ENCODED_SIGN_OF_THE_FINGERPRINT]"
        }
     }
}
```

## CARD STRUCTURE
Virgil Card has the following parameters:

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|public_key*|This Parameter must contain a Base64-encoded public key value in DER or PEM format.|
|scope*|This parameter determines a Virgil Card's scope that can be either "global" or "application". Application Virgil Cards are accessible only within the application they were created within. Global Virgil Cards are available in all the applications.|
|identity_type*|This parameter must be "email" for a confirmed Virgil Card and can be any value for a segregated one.|
|identity*|Must be a valid email for a confirmed Virgil Card with an identity_type of "email" and can be any value for a segregated one.|
|data|This parameter is an associative array that contains application specific parameters. All keys must contain static characters and digits only. The length of keys and values must not exceed 256 characters. Please note that more than 16 data items cannot be persisted at a time.|
|info|This parameter is an associative array with predefined keys that contain information about the device on which the keypair was created. The keys are always device_name and device and the values must not exceed 256 characters. Both keys are optional but at least one of them must be specified, if the info parameter is specified.|
|signs*|This parameter is mandatory to authorize the creation of a Virgil Card by the Virgil Card holder or by the authorized application. The signs parameter must always contain either the Virgil Card holder's signature, the application signature, or the Virgil Registration Authority Service signature (or both). The signed_digest is calculated as a BASE64_ENCODE(SIGN(FINGERPRINT, PRIVATE_KEY)). The private key must belong to the Virgil Card holder, the Application, or the Virgil Registration Authority service. The signs parameter must always contain signature of the Virgil Registration Authority service to create a Virgil Card with scope = "global".|
|content_snapshot|This is a Base64-encoded string with a JSON representation of the Virgil Card data required for an operation '(contentSnapshot = BASE64(virgilCardJsonData))'. The content_snapshot will be persisted alongside the Virgil Card, and can't be changed during the Virgil Card's lifetime. It can be used by the Virgil Card's owner and the application service, to make sure the Virgil Card's data was not changed by a 3rd-party.|
|created_at|This parameter shows the time that the Virgil Card was created.|
|card_version|Virgil Card Version|
|id|Virgil Card ID|
|relations|This relation entity describes a trusted, one-way relationship between the source Virgil Card specified in the URI, and the destination Virgil Card which the CSR is specified to, in the request body.|
* â€” These parameters are mandatory

Example:
```
public_key    = "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBQVUJMSUMgS0VZLS0tLS0KTULS0tLS1CRUdJTiBQVUJMSUMgS0VZLS0tLS0KTU.LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBQVUJMSUMgS0VZLS0tLS0KTU.LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBQVUJMSUMgS0VZLS0tLS0KTU.";
identity_type = "email";
identity      = "user@VirgilSecurity.com";
scope         = "global";
data          = {
    "custom_key_1": "custom_value_1",
    "custom_key_2": "custom_value_2"
};
info = {
    "device": "iPhone6s",
    "device_name": "Space grey one"
};
```

Each Virgil Card is created by passing the contentSnapshot, which contains all data related to the Virgil Card, and is represented as a JSON.
The JSON representation:

```
requestJsonData = {       
    "public_key":"LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBQVUJMSUMgS0VZLS0t...",
    "identity_type":"email",
    "identity":"user@VirgilSecurity.com",
    "scope":"global",
    "data":{"custom_key_1":"custom_value_1",
            "custom_key_2":"custom_value_2"},
    "info":{"device":"iPhone6s",
            "device_name":"Space grey one"}}
```

The content snapshot will persist alongside the Virgil Card, and is not supposed to be changed during the Virgil Card's lifetime. It can be used by the Virgil Card's owner and the application service to make sure the Virgil Card's data was not changed by a 3rd-party.

```
contentSnapshot       = BASE64(virgilCardJsonData)
virgilCardFingerprint = SHA256(virgilCardJsonData)
virgilCardId          = HEX(virgilCardFingerprint)
```


## CREATE CARD ENDPOINT

The endpoint creates a Virgil Card entity.
The Virgil Card creation action requires an authorization header from the Virgil Card owner which is performed via the additional signatures parameter. It must be an associative array with all necessary information about card signers.

### Request Info
```
HTTP Request method    POST
Request URL            https://cards.virgilsecurity.com/v4/card

    }
}
```
To create a confirmed Virgil Card, it's necessary to delegate the card's creation to the Virgil RA service. The Virgil Card will be marked as confirmed as long as the Virgil Identity sign was passed.
In order to create an unconfirmed, segregated Virgil Card, one must simply set the scope request parameter to "application" and pass a valid application sign item in the signs list;
Beware that to create a Global Virgil Card, it's mandatory to perform a call to the Virgil Registration Authority service instead of the Virgil Cards service.
The request that creates a Virgil Card contains two signed items: for the application holder and for the application.
After the Virgil Card's endpoint invocation, the signs list is filled with an additional Virgil Cards service sign. All Virgil Card data is passed in the content_snapshot parameter, then the Virgil Cards service creates an additional sign item, with its own fingerprint used as a key to prove that it really created the Virgil Card.

        }
    }
}
```

The content_snapshot parameter is a JSON representation that contains the following parameters:
```
{
    "card_id": "af6799a2f26376731abb9abf32b5f2...",
    "revocation_reason": "unspecified"
}
```

### Response Body
```
some code?
```

### Parameters:
|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|id|This parameter is the id of the Virgil Card to be removed.|
|revocation_reason|Contains one of the values from the list: "unspecified" or "compromised".|
|meta.signs|This parameter must contain an entry with the application sign for all the Virgil Cards which have their scope value set to "application"|

To revoke a Virgil Card with scope = "global" , it's mandatory to pass both the Client and the Virgil Registration Authority sign.

## CREATE CARD RELATION
This endpoint shows how to add a relation to a Virgil Card. The relation entity describes a trusted one-way relationship between the source Virgil Card specified in the URI and the destination Virgil Card, of which the CSR is specified in the request body.
Relations work similarly to the signs mechanism, but specifies the opposite trust direction. If the signs collection lists the Virgil Cards that were verified by the source Virgil Card at the moment of its creation, the relations collection will list all the Virgil Cards trusted by the source Virgil Card.
